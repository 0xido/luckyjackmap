# ‚õµÔ∏è Lucky Jack Map

Lucky Jack Map is a website about the main characters "Lucky" Jack Aubrey & Stephen Maturin, who appear in Patrick O¬¥Brian¬¥s books and the film "Master and Commander: The far side of the world".

The most interesting section is the map of 1800, where you can find the path of each book, the markers with the most important events/places/battles, filter them (not yet) and access the summary of each one with their own synopsis, main characters, and ships.

# Development 

The website is built with HTML/CSS/JS and I¬¥m considering to moving it to another platform that reduces the creation time of each summary page.

I¬¥ve used the base of the project [ROP-MAP](https://rop-map.com/) created by @Algernhon to make the map section, and I¬¥ve been using DALL-E to create most of the popups images.

This project also uses [LeafLet library](https://leafletjs.com) for the interactive map like Algernhon project.


## Structure

- ./books/ - Main page of books and page of each book.
- ./css/ - All CSS files of the project (each scss file to be worked on separately)
- ./data/ - All markers/paths data in JSON format *(copied of Algerhon project)*
- ./img/ - All images of: books covers *(not used at the moment, are linked now)*, icons, markers, paths (for each book summary), popups images, resources
- ./js/ - JS part of the project *(copied of Algerhon project)*, but with some separation between the parts.


## Roadmap

The **0.1 version** - is not available on production, I¬¥ve to create more content and do more research for each book and path. Now you can play with:
 - [X] Show the path and part of the events in the books (HMS Surprise, The Mauritius Command, Desolation Island, The Fortune of War and Surgeon¬¥s Mate).
 - [X] Open and close the filter section.
 - [X] Access the structure of the books page and the first book page (Master & Commander).
 - [X] Find a way to create multitude of paths for each book with a different color. This is because different paths appear in each book.
 - [ ] Responsive is not available, so small resolutions are not available either.


Next steps I would like to take:
- [ ] Create a filter system which works correctly (it doesn¬¥t work right now).
- [ ] Make the responsive.
- [ ] Evaluate the move to a platform.

 I¬¥m open to any help you can give me (specially in code, I¬¥m a bit noobie üòÖ). You can contact me on Twitter [@AMLomba](https://twitter.com/AMLomba) or here.
 

# Credits

Special thanks to:
 - Algernhon [@algernhon] for his project [ROP-MAP](https://rop-map.com/), I was looking to find a way to create this project and he gave me the base with his code. 
 - Tom Horn for his data and for allowing me to use it. All the data markers and paths have been taken from [The Patrick O'Brian Mapping Project](https://www.cannonade.net/index.php).
